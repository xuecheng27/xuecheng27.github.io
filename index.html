        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electronic Engineering of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 
            co-advised by Prof. Xinbing Wang and Prof. Luoyi Fu. I am broadly interested in fundamental theories in modern 
            information systems, including but not limited to applied probability, estimation theory, stochastic processes,
            networking, and combinatorics.
        </p>
        <p>
            I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University with a B.S. in Information Engineering. Here is my resume.
