        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electronic Engineering of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 
            co-advised by Prof. Xinbing Wang and Prof. Luoyi Fu. I am broadly interested in fundamental theories in modern 
            information systems, including but not limited to applied probability, estimation theory, stochastic processes,
            networking, and combinatorics.
        </p>
        <p>
            I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University with a B.S. in Information Engineering. Here is my resume.

        <h1>Research Overview</h1>
        <p>
            My research interests lie in the intersection of the pure mathematics and real world system modeling, with applications
            in social networks, and biology. The goal of my research is to provide a thorough and deep understanding of fundamental
            limits of (possibly networked) dynamic systems, and develop simple, flexible, efficient, and graceful algorithms that can 
            achieve provably good performance. Until now, my PhD research activities can be organized as follows.
        </p>
        <h3>Source node detection in a network</h3>
        <h3>Scaling law analysis in large scale wireless ad hoc network</h3>
        <p>During my bachelor study, I work on the scaling laws of capacity and energy efficiency in wireless networks.</p>
        <p>1) In contrast to previous works, we consider a heterogeneous distribution function to model the location of nodes in 
            the ad hoc network.
        </p>
        <p>
            2) We not only analyze the scaling law of capacity, but also obtain the scaling results on energy efficiency by studying 
            the average hop counts of a single multicast flow.
